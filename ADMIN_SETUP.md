# Admin Bookings Management System

This document explains the admin bookings management system that has been implemented for your photo studio application.

## Overview

The admin system allows designated admin users to:
- View all bookings in the system
- Filter bookings by status and date range
- View detailed statistics (today's orders, weekly/monthly totals, revenue)
- Access detailed information about each booking including customer details and time slots

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

Execute the migration to add the `is_admin` field to your users table:

```sql
-- Run this in your database
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_is_admin ON users(is_admin) WHERE is_admin = true;
```

Or use your migration system:
```bash
# If you have a migration runner
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/src/database/migrations/004-add-admin-role.sql
```

### 2. Set a User as Admin

To make a user an admin, run this SQL command with the user's email:

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Rebuild Backend (TypeScript)

The backend needs to be rebuilt to include the new TypeScript changes:

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

### 4. Restart Your Application

Restart both frontend and backend to apply all changes.

## Security

- Admin routes are protected with `adminAuth` middleware
- Regular users cannot access admin endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- Admin status is checked on every request
- Frontend automatically redirects non-admins away from admin pages

## UI/UX Design

- Admin elements use a golden/yellow color scheme (#fbbf24) to distinguish from regular features
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Uses PrimeReact components for professional data table functionality
- Statistics cards have gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Loading states and empty states are handled

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions you might want to consider:
- Edit/cancel bookings from admin panel
- Export bookings to CSV/Excel
- Email customers from admin panel
- Advanced analytics and charts
- User management (activate/deactivate users)
- Manual booking creation
- Revenue reports by date range

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin access required" error
- Ensure the user is set as admin in the database
- Log out and log back in to refresh the token
- Check that the migration ran successfully

### Admin button not showing
- Verify user has `is_admin: true` in the database
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache and reload

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run build` in the backend directory
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for any linting errors

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs for authentication issues
3. Verify database migration completed successfully
4. Ensure admin flag is set correctly in database
