# ðŸ”§ Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem
Backend deployment was failing during "Deploying outputs..." phase with no error log.

## Root Cause
The email templates (HTML files) in `src/templates/emails/` were not being copied to the `dist/` folder during the TypeScript build process. When the code ran on Vercel, it tried to load templates from `dist/templates/emails/` but the files didn't exist.

## Solution

### 1. Created Copy Templates Script
**File:** `backend/scripts/copy-templates.js`
- Cross-platform Node.js script to copy email templates
- Runs automatically after TypeScript compilation
- Copies all files from `src/templates/` to `dist/templates/`

### 2. Updated Build Script
**File:** `backend/package.json`
```json
"build": "tsc && node scripts/copy-templates.js"
```

### 3. Updated Vercel Configuration
**File:** `backend/vercel.json`
- Added `includeFiles` to ensure templates are included in deployment:
```json
"config": {
  "includeFiles": ["dist/templates/**"]
}
```

## Files Changed
- âœ… `backend/scripts/copy-templates.js` (NEW)
- âœ… `backend/package.json` (updated build script)
- âœ… `backend/vercel.json` (added includeFiles)

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy
4. Email templates will now be properly included in the deployment

## Verification
After deployment, check that:
1. âœ… Build completes successfully
2. âœ… Templates are copied (check build logs for "Email templates copied successfully!")
3. âœ… Deployment completes without errors
4. âœ… Backend is accessible and functioning
