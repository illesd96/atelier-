```
Returns invoice data alongside order information.

```

### 5. **Translations**

```json
{
  "invoice": "Invoice",
  "invoiceNumber": "Invoice Number",
  "invoiceStatus": "Invoice Status",
  "downloadInvoice": "Download Invoice",
  "invoiceDownloadFailed": "Failed to download invoice. Please try again."
}
```

  "invoice": "Sz√°mla",
  "invoiceNumber": "Sz√°mlasz√°m",
  "invoiceStatus": "Sz√°mla st√°tusza",
  "downloadInvoice": "Sz√°mla let√∂lt√©se",
