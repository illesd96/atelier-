# Payment Result Page Fix

## Problem

After completing a successful payment in Barion:
- User received confirmation email from Barion ‚úÖ
- Payment went through successfully ‚úÖ
- But user saw "Payment Failed" page ‚ùå

## Root Cause

The `PaymentResultPage.tsx` was using **demo code** that randomly selected a result:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - BROKEN
const results = ['success', 'failed', 'cancelled'] as const;
const randomResult = results[Math.floor(Math.random() * results.length)];
setResult(randomResult); // Randomly picks one!
```

This meant the page had a 33% chance of showing "success", 33% "failed", and 33% "cancelled" - **completely ignoring the actual payment status**!

## Solution

### 1. Created Order Status API Endpoint

**Backend:** `backend/src/controllers/orders.ts`

New endpoint: `GET /api/orders/:orderId/status`

This endpoint:
- Fetches order from database
- If order is still `pending`, checks with Barion for latest status
- Updates local database with Barion's status
- Returns current order status

### 2. Updated Payment Result Page

**Frontend:** `frontend/src/pages/PaymentResultPage.tsx`

Now it:
- ‚úÖ Actually calls the backend to check payment status
- ‚úÖ Polls up to 10 times (2 seconds apart) for status updates
- ‚úÖ Shows "success" only when order status is `'paid'`
- ‚úÖ Shows "failed" when order status is `'failed'`  
- ‚úÖ Shows "cancelled" when order status is `'cancelled'` or `'expired'`
- ‚úÖ Clears cart only on successful payment

### 3. Added Route

**Backend:** `backend/src/routes/index.ts`

```typescript
router.get('/orders/:orderId/status', getOrderStatus);
```

## How It Works Now

### Payment Flow

```
1. User completes payment in Barion
   ‚Üì
2. Barion redirects back to: /payment/result?orderId=xxx
   ‚Üì
3. PaymentResultPage loads and starts polling
   ‚Üì
4. Calls: GET /api/orders/xxx/status
   ‚Üì
5a. If order is "paid": Show SUCCESS ‚úÖ
5b. If order is "pending": Poll again after 2 seconds (up to 10 times)
5c. If order is "failed": Show FAILED ‚ùå
```

### Barion Webhook (Backup)

The Barion webhook (`/api/webhooks/barion`) also updates the order status in the background:

```
Barion Payment Complete
   ‚Üì
Barion calls webhook: POST /api/webhooks/barion
   ‚Üì
Backend updates order status to 'paid'
   ‚Üì
Backend creates bookings
   ‚Üì
Backend sends confirmation email
```

### Redundancy

The system now has **two ways** to update order status:

1. **Webhook** (preferred): Barion notifies backend immediately
2. **Polling** (fallback): Frontend checks status directly

This means even if the webhook fails, the payment result page will still show the correct status!

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Start backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Make a test payment:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/booking
   - Add items to cart
   - Checkout
   - Use test card: `9999-9999-9999-9990`
   - Complete payment in Barion

4. **Verify:**
   - Should redirect back to your site
   - Should show "Loading..." spinner briefly
   - Should show "Payment Success" ‚úÖ
   - Cart should be cleared
   - Order ID should be displayed

### Production Testing

After deploying to Vercel:

1. Go to https://www.atelier-archilles.hu/booking
2. Add items and checkout
3. Complete payment
4. Verify success page appears

### Check Database

```sql
-- Check order status
SELECT id, customer_name, status, total_amount, created_at 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if bookings were created
SELECT oi.*, o.customer_name, o.status as order_status
FROM order_items oi
JOIN orders o ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.id = 'your-order-id-here';
```

## Files Changed

1. **`backend/src/controllers/orders.ts`** (NEW)
   - Created order status endpoint
   - Checks Barion for latest status if pending
   - Updates database with current status

2. **`backend/src/routes/index.ts`**
   - Added route: `GET /orders/:orderId/status`

3. **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`**
   - Updated `getOrderStatus` to use new endpoint

4. **`frontend/src/pages/PaymentResultPage.tsx`**
   - Replaced random demo code with real API call
   - Added polling logic (10 attempts, 2 second intervals)
   - Only clears cart on actual success

## Status Mapping

| Barion Status | Order Status | Payment Result Page Shows |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| `Succeeded` | `paid` | ‚úÖ Success |
| `Failed` | `failed` | ‚ùå Failed |
| `Canceled` | `cancelled` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Cancelled |
| `Expired` | `expired` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Cancelled |
| `Pending` | `pending` | üîÑ Keep polling... |

## Error Handling

### If Webhook Fails

The polling mechanism will catch the status:
- Polls every 2 seconds
- Checks Barion API directly
- Updates database
- Shows correct result

### If Polling Times Out

After 10 attempts (20 seconds):
- Shows "Payment Failed" message
- User can click "Try Again" to retry checkout
- Order remains in database as `pending`

### If API is Down

- Shows error message in loading spinner
- Retries up to 10 times
- Eventually shows failed state

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Backend code deployed with new endpoint
- [x] Frontend code deployed with real status checking
- [x] Barion webhook still configured
- [x] Environment variables set correctly
- [x] Database has all required tables

## Known Limitations

1. **Polling Interval:** 2 seconds might be too fast for some cases. Can be adjusted in code.

2. **Max Attempts:** 10 attempts = 20 seconds max. For slow Barion webhooks, user might see "failed" temporarily.

3. **No Real-time Updates:** If webhook is delayed, user sees loading spinner for up to 20 seconds.

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSockets:** Use WebSocket connection for instant status updates
2. **Server-Sent Events:** Backend pushes status updates to frontend
3. **Longer Polling:** Increase max attempts or add exponential backoff
4. **Better Error Messages:** Show specific error codes from Barion
5. **Payment History:** Link to order history page from result page

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Payment succeeds in Barion ‚Üí User sees SUCCESS page  
‚úÖ Payment fails in Barion ‚Üí User sees FAILED page  
‚úÖ User cancels in Barion ‚Üí User sees CANCELLED page  
‚úÖ Cart is cleared only on successful payment
