---

## 🔄 Re-Test After Deploy

Run this SEO checker again:
- The tool you used before
- Should now show:
  - ✅ Title length: OK (57 chars)
  - ✅ Description length: OK (141 chars)
  - ✅ Open Graph: All tags present
  - ✅ Schema.org: Complete
  - ✅ H1/H2: Present

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### The only issue that will remain:
**"No internal links found"** - This is expected because:
- Your React app renders dynamically
- The SEO checker sees the initial HTML only
- Internal links ARE present (in React Router)
- This won't affect actual Google rankings

### Real internal links exist:
- HomePage → Studio pages ✅
- HomePage → Booking ✅
- Footer → All pages ✅
- Header → Navigation ✅

Google's crawler (unlike the tool) **DOES see these links** because it executes JavaScript.

## 📊 Monitoring

### After Deploy, Monitor:

**Week 1:**
- Check Search Console for crawl errors
- Verify structured data detected
- Check for any new warnings

**Week 2-4:**
- Monitor impressions in Search Console
- Check for rich results appearing
- Track click-through rate improvements
