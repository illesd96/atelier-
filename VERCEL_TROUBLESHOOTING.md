# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status: Frontend Building ✅

Your frontend deployment is progressing! The warnings you're seeing are normal.

## Understanding the Build Output

### ✅ Normal Warnings (Can Ignore)
```
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array
npm warn deprecated eslint@8.57.1
```
These are **deprecation warnings** from dependencies. They won't affect your deployment.

### ⚠️ Moderate Vulnerabilities
```
2 moderate severity vulnerabilities
```
These are likely from development dependencies and won't affect production. You can fix them later.

## What's Happening Now

1. ✅ Repository cloned from GitHub
2. ✅ Dependencies installed (253 packages)
3. ⏳ Build command running (`npm run build`)
4. ⏳ Waiting for Vite to build your React app

## Expected Next Steps

You should see:
```
> vite build
> Building for production...
> ✓ built in XXXms
> Build completed successfully
```

Then Vercel will deploy the `dist` folder.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails with "Module not found"

**Solution:** Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build  # Test locally first
```

### Issue 2: Environment Variable Not Set

**Error:** `VITE_API_URL is undefined`

**Solution:** 
1. Go to Vercel Project Settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Add: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api`
4. Redeploy

### Issue 3: "Command failed: npm run build"

**Check:**
- Is `vite.config.ts` correct?
- Are all imports valid?
- Test build locally first

### Issue 4: TypeScript Errors

**Solution:** Make sure all types are correct:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Will show TS errors if any
```

## Security Vulnerabilities Fix (Optional)

After successful deployment, fix vulnerabilities:

```bash
cd frontend
npm audit fix
# or for breaking changes:
npm audit fix --force

# Commit and push
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix npm vulnerabilities"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy the update.

## Frontend Deployment Checklist

- [x] Repository connected to Vercel
- [x] Root directory set to `frontend`
- [x] Framework detected as Vite
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Build completed (in progress)
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Site accessible

## If Build Succeeds

You'll see:
```
✓ Deployment ready
Successfully deployed to:
https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

**Next steps:**
1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Test the site
3. Configure `VITE_API_URL` if you haven't
4. Deploy backend next

## If Build Fails

**Get the error message**, then:

1. **Check build logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Common fixes:**
   - Fix TypeScript errors
   - Update imports
   - Check `vite.config.ts`
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Backend Deployment (After Frontend)

Once frontend is deployed:

1. Create **new Vercel project**
2. Import **same GitHub repo**
3. Set root directory to `backend`
4. Add all environment variables (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
5. Deploy

## Need Help?

### Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on the deployment
4. View "Build Logs" and "Function Logs"

### Test Locally First
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test production build

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Common Environment Variables Missing

**Frontend:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app/api
```

**Backend:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
BARION_POS_KEY=...
BARION_ENVIRONMENT=prod
SMTP_HOST=...
SMTP_USER=...
SMTP_PASS=...
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

## Performance Tips

### After Successful Deployment

1. **Enable Vercel Analytics** (free)
2. **Test on mobile devices**
3. **Check Lighthouse score**
4. **Monitor error logs**

### Optimization (Later)

1. Image optimization
2. Code splitting (Vite does this automatically)
3. Enable compression
4. Use CDN for assets
