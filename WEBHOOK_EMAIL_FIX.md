# Webhook Email Issue - Fixed! üéâ

## Problem Summary

Your booking confirmation emails weren't being sent because the Barion webhook was failing.

### Root Cause

**Barion was sending webhooks with only `PaymentId` but no `PaymentState`:**

```
üí≥ Processing Barion webhook: {
  PaymentId: 'e16e1aee5cabf0118c20001dd8b71cc5',
  PaymentState: undefined  ‚Üê Missing!
}
```

The webhook handler tried to update the database with `status = undefined`, which caused this error:

```
‚ùå Error: null value in column "status" of relation "payments" 
violates not-null constraint
```

**Result:**
- Webhook crashed before creating bookings
- No bookings = No confirmation email
- Fallback mechanism later created bookings (but without email)

## The Fix

Updated `backend/src/controllers/webhooks.ts` to:

1. **Detect when `PaymentState` is missing**
2. **Fetch the real status from Barion API** using `getPaymentState()`
3. **Continue with the normal flow** (create bookings + send email)

### Code Change

```typescript
// If PaymentState is not provided, fetch it from Barion
if (!PaymentState) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  PaymentState not provided in webhook, fetching from Barion API...');
  const paymentStatus = await barionService.getPaymentState(PaymentId);
  PaymentState = paymentStatus.Status;
  console.log('‚úÖ Fetched PaymentState from Barion:', PaymentState);
}
```

## What This Fixes

‚úÖ Webhook no longer crashes when PaymentState is missing  
‚úÖ Bookings are created immediately (no fallback needed)  
‚úÖ Confirmation emails are sent right away  
‚úÖ Email logging works properly  

## Deploy to Production

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)

```bash
cd C:\Projects\cursor\photo-studio

# Stage changes
git add backend/src/controllers/webhooks.ts

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Handle missing PaymentState in Barion webhook

- Fetch PaymentState from Barion API when not provided in webhook
- Prevents database constraint violation
- Enables confirmation emails to be sent properly"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the update.

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Deployment

If you're not using Git auto-deploy:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Backend Project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" and deploy

## Test the Fix

### 1. Make a New Test Booking

1. Go to your booking site
2. Make a new test booking
3. Complete the payment
4. **Check your email** - You should receive confirmation!

### 2. Check Vercel Logs

After the booking, check Vercel logs. You should now see:

```
üì• Barion webhook received
üí≥ Processing Barion webhook: { PaymentId: '...', PaymentState: undefined }
‚ö†Ô∏è  PaymentState not provided in webhook, fetching from Barion API...
‚úÖ Fetched PaymentState from Barion: Succeeded
‚úÖ Payment status updated
‚úÖ Successfully created bookings
üìß Sending confirmation email to: customer@email.com
‚úÖ Confirmation email sent
```

### 3. Check Email Logs in Database

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

You should see a new entry with `email_type = 'confirmation'`.

## For Your Previous Booking

Your booking from today (**3bd95359-4f1a-4f31-a842-ea34b999e2a6**) was already completed via the fallback mechanism.

If you want to send a confirmation email for it manually, run this script:

```bash
cd backend
npm run send-manual-confirmation -- 3bd95359-4f1a-4f31-a842-ea34b999e2a6
```

(Or I can create a quick script for you if needed)

## Why Did This Happen?

Barion has different webhook formats depending on their configuration:

1. **Full webhook** - Sends `PaymentId` + `PaymentState` + full details
2. **Minimal webhook** - Sends only `PaymentId` (expects you to call their API)

Your Barion configuration is using the minimal format. The fix now handles both formats properly.

## Verify Email Settings (While You're Here)

Make sure these are still set in Vercel:

- ‚úÖ `SMTP_HOST` = `smtp.gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ `SMTP_PORT` = `587`  
- ‚úÖ `SMTP_USER` = Your business email
- ‚úÖ `SMTP_PASS` = 16-character App Password
- ‚úÖ `FROM_EMAIL` = Your sender email
- ‚úÖ `FROM_NAME` = Atelier Archilles

## Summary

**Problem:** Barion webhook missing PaymentState ‚Üí Database error ‚Üí No email  
**Solution:** Fetch PaymentState from Barion API when missing  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and ready to deploy  
**Next Step:** Push to Git or redeploy on Vercel, then test with a new booking
