  Whether you're a photographer looking to shoot indoors or a client preparing 
  for a portrait session, these tips will help you make the most of your studio

  ensures you use your studio time efficiently.

  <li>Shot list with specific poses or angles</li>
  <li>Reference images for lighting setups</li>
  <li>Outfit changes timeline</li>
  <li>Props and accessories list</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Arrive Early for Setup</h2>
<p>
  Give yourself time to set up lighting, test your camera settings, and prepare 
  the space. At Atelier Archilles, your rental includes setup time, so use it 
  wisely.
</p>

<h2>3. Understand Your Lighting</h2>
<p>
  Studio lighting can seem complex at first, but start with basic setups. Our 
  studios include professional Profoto lighting systems with softboxes and 
  reflectors. Experiment with different positions to achieve your desired look.

  test shots to build confidence.
</p>
